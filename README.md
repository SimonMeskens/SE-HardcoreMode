Space Engineers - Hardcore Mode
===============================

A more challenging survival mode for Space Engineers. There's two mods, one contains a few new scenarios , the other the general hardcore changes. You can play with either one of these mods. Playing the hardcore scenarios with vanilla mechanics will still provide a fun challenge, but playing any vanilla scenario with the hardcore mode messes with the balance and is less recommended (though still a challenge).

Hardcore Scenarios
------------------
Note: In sparse generation, it's advised to generate as many asteroids as possible. It's tough enough to find asteroids in sparse generation, generating more won't affect difficulty.

### Sparse Asteroids
__Difficulty__: Medium  
__Generation__: Sparse  
__Explanation__: Sparse Asteroids is like regular asteroids, but the distance between large asteroids is huge. You'll need to explore to find more. You're guaranteed to spawn near asteroids though.

### Hardcore
__Difficulty__: Hard  
__Generation__: Normal  
__Explanation__: You start with a small wrecked ship, which has the barebones components to create everything you need. You'll need to grind it down to get the necessary resources. Generation is almost as dense as default.

## Sparse Hardcore
__Difficulty__: Very Hard  
__Generation__: Sparse  
__Explanation__: Sparse Hardcore is the same as hardcore, but with sparse generation. This is what is considered the "default" hardcore mode, which the hardcore mod is balanced for.

## Super Hardcore
__Difficulty__: Super Hard  
__Generation__: Sparse+  
__Explanation__: This is almost the same as Sparse Hardcore, but you are not guaranteed to spawn near asteroids. Getting your ship running with just the starting resources, so you can travel towards an asteroid and even finding asteroids can take hours. This is the ultimate challenge, but it's not recommended unless you like pain, as it can sometimes be very hard to locate asteroids, even if you can get the ship running.

Hardcore Mode
-------------
Hardcore Mode rebalances the game to offer more of a challenge.

Note: when generating a world, turn on passing cargo ships, or you won't be able to get certain components, like reactors.

The main mechanics are:
* __Refining__:  
  refining is way less efficient, so resources become more scarce and automated mining becomes a priority. The ore detector has a huge range and power consumption now, so you can use it to find more asteroids more easily.
* __Ship Size Differences__:  
  ship sizes matter. Small ships will be battery powered and need a recharge station, large ships require tons of power, while stations can be mostly run on solar. There's also a difference in which tools are available. Small ships are for drilling, large ships are for grinding.
* __Non-craftable Blocks__:  
  certain blocks are not craftable, like reactors, small ship grinders, small ship solar panels and large ship drills. This makes capturing passing cargo vessels essential if you want those items, especially the reactors. Large thruster power consumption was dramatically increased, so if you want to use those, salvaging reactors becomes a necessity.
  Note that you can't deconstruct non-craftables and re-craft them, so you'll have to use tugs and merge blocks to install them in your ships.
  Also note that blocks have been color coded in the block screen. Orange blocks can only be crafted for a certain size of ship, red blocks can't be crafted for any size. The non-craftables will have a component that says "NOT CRAFTABLE".
* __Power Generation__:  
  reactors are non-craftable, solars can only be installed on large ships, but most forms of power generation have been significantly made better, so solar is actually usable and salvaging a large reactor is a real upgrade.
* __Passing Cargo Ships__:  
  passing cargo ships have been altered so you'll see more military ships. Be careful out there!
